            <p>
              The research into parallels between Buddhist texts of all schools
              has given us a wealth of information about the history of these
              texts and the teachings of the Buddha. It has played an important
              role in changing our perspectives on various topics, like for
              instance the legality of Theravada BhikkhunÄ« ordination and the
              authenticity of Early Buddhist texts.
